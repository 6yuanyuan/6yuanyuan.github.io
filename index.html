        Welcome,

        my young friend. I am Vassily Kandinsky, an artist whose passion for abstraction has helped shape the very essence of modern art. Perhaps this is your first time encountering my work, or maybe my name is already familiar. Today, I invite you to explore Several Circles. In this moment, we’ll establish a unique connection.
        You are stepping into a world where colors and shapes intertwine, where each point tells a story and each color expresses an inner voice. I have dedicated my life to exploring how colors and forms can evoke emotions and resonate with the soul. Here, the bond between shapes and feelings will reveal itself in new ways.
        I warmly invite you to journey deeper, to uncover the stories within each shape and to feel the soul within every color.
        Art is a mirror of its time, and our mirrors reflect each other. This is why no era exists in isolation… we are not alone in the universe. Now, shall we begin our journey?
