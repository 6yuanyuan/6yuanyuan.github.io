            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                I was born in Moscow in 1866, but my heart has always sought something beyond the confines of my birthplace. My early path was not in art but in law and economics, a path I followed at Moscow University. Yet, around the age of 30, a sudden inner calling led me away from legal codes and financial statements. I felt drawn to colors, shapes, and the language of the soul that art could express. So I left my established life and moved to Munich, where my real journey began.

            <h3>My Style</h3>
            <p>
                My art doesn't imitate the world; rather, it conveys the world as I feel it. I don't paint what I see; I paint what I feel. Color for me is a tool of the soul, and I believe it can evoke sound, music, and inner movement. I am often asked why I focus on circles and abstract forms. I find them pure, boundless, like the universe itself - shapes that transcend definition and evoke harmony.

            <p>Welcome, my young friend. I am Vassily Kandinsky, an artist whose passion for abstraction has helped shape the very essence of modern art. Perhaps this is your first time encountering my work, or maybe my name is already familiar. Today, I invite you to explore Several Circles. In this moment, we’ll establish a unique connection.
                You are stepping into a world where colors and shapes intertwine, where each point tells a story and each color expresses an inner voice. I have dedicated my life to exploring how colors and forms can evoke emotions and resonate with the soul. Here, the bond between shapes and feelings will reveal itself in new ways.
                I warmly invite you to journey deeper, to uncover the stories within each shape and to feel the soul within every color.
                Art is a mirror of its time, and our mirrors reflect each other. This is why no era exists in isolation… we are not alone in the universe. Now, shall we begin our journey?</p>

            <h3>My Artistic Journey</h3>
            <p>
                Munich opened up a new world for me. It was there that I explored the power of color and symbolism, studying under Anton Ažbe and later at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1911, alongside my friend Franz Marc, I co-founded Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). We believed art could be more than just an image - it could be a window to the spiritual. When I joined the Bauhaus in 1922, it felt like destiny. Teaching at Bauhaus in Dessau, I was able to merge my theories with practice, guiding students to see art as a deep expression of the human spirit. After the Bauhaus closed in 1933, I continued my work in Paris, painting until the end.

            <h3>Hobbies and Inspirations</h3>
            <p>
                Music is my closest companion, and it is through sound that I often see color. My favorite composers Wagner, Schönberg speak to my soul. Just as music uses notes and rhythm, I use color and shape to convey meaning. Nature is also a source of inspiration, with its organic rhythms and patterns that echo across all forms of life. Most of all, I seek the spiritual. Art is my bridge to a deeper world, and through it, I hope to speak directly to the heart and soul.

        In early 1926, while teaching at the Bauhaus in Dessau, I created this piece—Several Circles. The Bauhaus had just moved to Dessau, and the new campus exuded a modern spirit, symbolizing innovation and experimentation. Paul Klee and I lived in the Meisterhaus, designed by Gropius. This place was not only our home but the center of our daily lives. Every window and wall resonated with geometric beauty, and the spacious terrace allowed us to feel the changing seasons in nature. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter all seemed exceptionally vibrant here.

        <p>Our days in Dessau were simple yet fulfilling. Balancing teaching and creation, we often took walks by the nearby lakes and along the Elbe River to relax. Our home became a gathering spot for friends, where everyone loved to come over for coffee and conversation. Guggenheim and Duchamp were frequent visitors; we would sit on the terrace, talking about art, life, and everything in between, surrounded by laughter. These moments remain some of the warmest memories I carry.</p>

        <p>The Meisterhaus had wonderful natural light, with sunlight streaming through the windows, casting geometric shadows on the white walls—much like the shapes I depicted on canvas. In this inspiring environment, I created Several Circles.

            In this painting, circles of different sizes and colors intertwine, and I hope they bring you a sense of visual harmony, even a meditative calm. Blue is deep and mysterious, like the boundless night sky; yellow is warm and vibrant, like the fire of life; while red is filled with passion, like the pulse of life. Each color has its own 'voice', softly singing together on the canvas. If you cannot hear them, perhaps try drawing while listening to music—you might discover a new tension and expression within art.</p>
