        Welcome,

        I am Vassily Kandinsky, an artist whose passion for abstraction has shaped the very essence of modern art. Perhaps this is your first time encountering my work, or maybe you’ve heard of me before. Today, I invite you to explore one of my creations, Several Circles. In this moment, we’ll establish a unique connection in this space.
        
        You’re stepping into a world where colors and shapes intertwine, where every point tells a story, and every color expresses an inner voice. I have dedicated my life to exploring how color and geometry can convey emotions and resonate with the soul. Here, you’ll find that the relationship between shapes and feelings becomes ever clearer.
        
        I warmly invite you to journey deeper into my world, to uncover the stories within each shape and to feel the soul that lives within every color. <br><br>

I have always believed that art is a mirror of its time, and our mirrors reflect each other, which is precisely why no era exists in isolation...we are not alone in the universe. 
Anyway, shall we start the journey?
